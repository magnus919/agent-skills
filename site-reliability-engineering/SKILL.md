# Site Reliability Engineering

A comprehensive methodology for designing, operating, and improving reliable production systems. Rooted in Google SRE principles and extended with modern practices for incident command, observability engineering, error budget governance, and operational excellence.

## When to Load This Skill

| Trigger | What It Means |
|---|---|
| "Design reliability into this system" | SLO/SLI framework, error budget policy, resilience architecture |
| "Run an incident postmortem" | Blameless postmortem with timeline, 5 Whys, action tracking |
| "Improve our on-call" | Rotation design, alert tuning, toil reduction, escalation policy |
| "Build observability" | The Four Golden Signals, dashboard design, alert rule patterns |
| "Do a reliability review" | Architecture review against SRE principles, risk assessment |
| "I need an incident commander" | Incident command framework, role cards, communication templates |
| "Automate this operational task" | Toil assessment, automation decision tree, runbook pattern |
| "Adopt SRE in this organization" | Engagement boundaries, maturity, team model, and change adoption |
| "Review this reliability design" | User journeys, dependencies, overload, configuration, canary, durability |
| "Our SRE team is overloaded" | Operational-load diagnosis, protected engineering time, recovery plan |
| "Improve incident learning or sustainable on-call" | Cognitive load, psychological safety, documentation, exercises |
## When not to use

Use [release-engineering](../release-engineering/SKILL.md) to plan releases, compose promotion and rollback gates, or coordinate a release train. Use [systematic-debugging](../systematic-debugging/SKILL.md) to find the cause of a specific failure. Operating the telemetry stack itself — Prometheus scrape configs, OpenTelemetry Collector pipelines, Loki ingest and retention, Prometheus rules files — belongs to [telemetry](../telemetry/SKILL.md); this skill owns the SLI/SLO and alert *design* those rules implement. Grafana product work — dashboards, panels, Grafana-side alert rules, contact points, notification policies — belongs to [grafana](../grafana/SKILL.md).

## Operational closure gate

For any automated mitigation, rollback, recovery action, or incident closeout:

1. **Bound the action before it starts.** Record the target, affected population, maximum blast radius, success criterion, abort/rollback criteria, rollback target and procedure, and who may stop or reverse it. Prefer the smallest reversible scope and staged expansion.
2. **Verify recovery at the user boundary.** After the action, follow the [R-01 closure evidence sequence](templates/runbook-template.md#r-01-post-incident-steps): check the user-facing SLOs, critical user journey, relevant dependency health, and data/state correctness. Observe a defined stability window and check secondary effects such as backlog recovery.
3. **Do not equate alert resolution with recovery.** A cleared alert or passing health endpoint is evidence, not a resolution verdict. If required evidence is missing, retain the `Mitigating` or `Monitoring` state, name the unverified boundary, and escalate rather than declare `Resolved`.
4. **Record the evidence.** Capture the action, scope, thresholds, observed recovery evidence, remaining uncertainty, and rollback/follow-up trigger in the incident or change record.

Automation may execute only pre-authorized bounded actions. It must stop and hand off when the blast radius, rollback path, or recovery evidence cannot be established.
