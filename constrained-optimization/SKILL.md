# Constrained optimization

Use this methodology to turn an optimization request into a defensible decision record.

## Workflow

1. **Frame the decision.** Name the decision maker, feasible action window, variable domains (continuous, integer, categorical, binary), bounds, units, and whether each variable is controllable.
2. **State objectives.** Write objective direction, units, aggregation, baseline, and acceptable tradeoffs. Keep multiple objectives separate until a decision maker chooses weights, lexicographic priority, epsilon constraints, or a Pareto review.
3. **Classify constraints.** Mark each as hard (must hold), soft (preference with an explicit penalty or relaxation), or informational. Define equality/inequality tolerance, feasibility predicate, and how violations are measured. Never hide a hard violation in a penalty score.
4. **Establish baselines.** Validate a known feasible incumbent, a simple exact or bounded baseline where available, and a heuristic baseline when exact solving is impractical. State what each baseline proves and does not prove.
5. **Choose the method.** Match solver family to domains, smoothness, scale, and proof needs. An exact solver can establish optimality or a bound when its status and gap support it; a heuristic supplies a candidate and empirical evidence. Do not call timeout or unknown an infeasible result.
6. **Run a fair comparison.** Fix an objective/constraint implementation, feasibility checker, compute budget, stopping rule, and reporting schema. For stochastic methods, use equal budgets and declared seeds/repeats. Keep solver configuration separate from the formulation.
7. **Independently validate.** Recompute objective and every constraint from the returned decision using an independent implementation or checker. Report feasible-best, violation magnitude, bound/gap, status, runtime, and unresolved unknowns separately.
8. **Decide and monitor.** Select a feasible solution or Pareto set with the tradeoff rationale, sensitivity/robustness evidence, owner, and rollback/re-optimization trigger. Record “infeasible under these constraints” only when infeasibility is proven or independently certified.

## Routing and exit

Load `references/formulation-and-evidence.md` for formulation, feasibility, solver status, bounds/gaps, and comparison rules. Load `references/multiobjective-and-robustness.md` for Pareto decisions and stochastic sensitivity. Use the templates for a formulation record and solution audit.

This skill owns decision formulation and evidence. Route statistical estimation, causal questions, and uncertainty models to `data-scientist`; route ML hyperparameter/model training optimization to `ml-engineering`; route operation of a named solver or cloud service to its tool skill. Stop when variables, objective units, hard constraints, feasibility checker, or budget are undefined.

## When not to use

Do not use this skill for inferential statistics, causal inference, or statistical model fitting. Do not use it for ML training/model selection methodology or for solver-specific installation and runbooks.
